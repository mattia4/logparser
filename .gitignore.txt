# This .gitignore file helps Git ignore files and directories that
# should not be committed to the repository.

# --- Node.js Dependencies and Frontend Build Output ---
# Ignores the 'node_modules' folder within the 'frontend' directory.
# This folder contains third-party dependencies downloaded by npm/yarn
# and should not be committed.
/frontend/node_modules/

# Ignores the 'dist' folder, which contains the compiled and bundled
# frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JS) generated by esbuild.
# These files are generated and embedded in the Go binary, so they
# shouldn't be committed directly.
/dist/

# Compiled Go binaries (executables) for various operating systems.
# These are generated during the build process and are platform-specific.
*.exe          # Windows executables

vendor/        # The 'vendor' directory if you're using 'go mod vendor'

# --- Input Log Files ---
# Ignores common text files, specifically your input log files.
# These are typically user-specific and not part of the source code.
*.txt # Catches logs.txt, logs2.txt, and any other .txt files

# --- IDE and Editor Specific Files ---
# Configuration files generated by Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
# and text editors. These are local to your development setup.
